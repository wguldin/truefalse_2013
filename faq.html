<p><span class="bold">What is the True/False Film Festival?</span></p>
	<p>It is a documentary film festival held in Columbia from Thursday to Sunday. There are also parties, panel discussions, a parade, a 5k run and other activities on top of movie screenings.</p>

<p><span class="bold">What films are showing?</span></p>
	<p>There are 42 films being screened at this year's festival. Check the list on True/False's website with descriptions and links to trailers.</p>

<p><span class="bold">How do I attend the screenings?</span></p>
	<p>Although all the passes to attend screenings have been sold out, there is still a way to attend. An hour before the film starts, go to the venue and look for the venue Queen – the most flamboyant person in the area. The Queen will hand over a Q number and the house manager will release all available seats five minutes prior to the start of the film. These tickets cost $10 for nonpassholders ($6 for students for films at the Missouri Theatre, The Blue Note and Jesse Hall); passholders get Q tickets for free.</p>

<p><span class="bold">Where are films being screened?</span></p>

<p>True/False shows films in eight venues. All are within walking distance of each other in downtown Columbia.</p>
